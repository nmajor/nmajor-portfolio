        <h1>Hello!</h1>
        <p>I am a full stack web developer. Throughout my career I've build and worked on projects in Ruby, Node, Python, and even Perl, using frameworks such as Rails, Sinatra, Express, Django, React and React Native, and these days I deploy my projects inside Docker contianers or serverless with AWS Lambda.</p>
        <p>I hope I am using enough buzz words.</p>
