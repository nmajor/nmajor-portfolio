              Steamleft had over 650,000 unique visitors, and 500,000 participating users in its first week. It was featured on PCGamer, Kotaku, The Escapist, and dozens of more online outlets.

              Steamleft is a webapp that aggregates and compares data between your personal Steam API and HowLongToBeat's data to estimate how much time it would take to beat your entire Steam library. It also provides hilarious alternatives for what you could be doing with your time, like reading The Hobbit or running across the United States a certain number of times.

              You know that shoebox on your top shelf where you keep all your favorite letters? Probably not! People dont write letters anymore. We Facebook message, we text, we snapchat, and sometimes we even email.
            </p>
            <p>
              Most of the time those emails are meaningless. But sometimes there is something special, something you would like to keep forever. MyEmailBook helps you create a custom printed book from your emails.
